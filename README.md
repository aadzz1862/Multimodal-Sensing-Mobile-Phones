# Multimodal-Sensing-Mobile-Phones
This project implements anomaly detection in motion sensor data collected from a mobile device. The data is gathered using the Sensor Logger App, capturing signals from the Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors. The primary goal is to detect deviations in movement patterns when a person is distracted.
